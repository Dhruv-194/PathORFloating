A minimalstic Android App to showcase the overlay window feature in Android System.

Main Screen: Designed a single-screen app with a button that is labelled as "Launch Overlay Link". This app initiates the background task of displaying the overlay window.

On-Screen Overlay: Once in the background, an on-screen overlay is displayed on the mobile phone. The overlay is translucent in view and covers a significant portion of the screen. This overlay contains a dummy content or a message (e.g., " Hello from PathOr").

User Interaction: The user can move the overlay up and down on the screen according to their will. Moreover I have added an interactive button for the user to dismiss the overlay and bring the app back to the foreground.
